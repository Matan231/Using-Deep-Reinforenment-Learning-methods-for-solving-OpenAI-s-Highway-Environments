# Using-Deep-Reinforenment-Learning-methods-for-solving-OpenAI-s-Highway-Environments
In our project, we investigated deep reinforcement learning strategies for OpenAI's Highway Environments, aiming to navigate autonomously using solely pixel information and rewards. We benchmarked various RL algorithms, seeking the optimal solution for these 2D driving simulations.
